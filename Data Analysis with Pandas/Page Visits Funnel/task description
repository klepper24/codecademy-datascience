Page Visits Funnel

Cool T-Shirts Inc. has asked you to analyze data on visits to their website. 
Your job is to build a funnel, which is a description of how many people continue to the next step of a multi-step process.

In this case, our funnel is going to describe the following process:

    A user visits CoolTShirts.com
    A user adds a t-shirt to their cart
    A user clicks “checkout”
    A user actually purchases a t-shirt
